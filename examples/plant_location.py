"""Example with Special Ordered Sets (SOS) type 1 and 2.
Plant location: one industry plans to install two plants in two different
regions, one to the west and another to the east. It must decide also the
production capacity of each plant and allocate clients to plants
in order to minimize shipping costs. We'll use SOS of type 1 to ensure that
only one of the plants in each region has a non-zero production capacity.
The cost :math:`f(z)` of building a plant with capacity :math:`z` grows according
to the non-linear function :math:`f(z)=1520 \log z`. Type 2 SOS will be used to
model the cost of installing each one of the plants.
